# Define styles for a new Word&nbsp;template

To make a new Word template means defining many styles. 
The easiest way I've found is to write a description of the styles, 
then run a macro that defines styles like the description.

- [Macro that defines styles]()
- [Phrases the macro can read]()
- [Get started with an example]()

## Style descriptions

Use one of the style descriptions below as a starting point. Add any new ones you write.

- [Technical report 1]() like ANSI's [Scientific and Technical Reports&mdash;Preparation, Presentation, and Preservation](https://www.niso.org/publications/z39.18-2005-r2010).
